This is the first poem. It will be a short information what you can expect from this site and further articles. I will keep here my personal projects and their descriptions mostly to have such things in one place and to not lose them. Additionally, if I will do/discover something IMHO interesting, I will probably write an article about that. At this point of my life I'm discovering C++ and C++ related stuff, so for now you can expect C++ related articles.

# Thanks for reading o/
